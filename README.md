# Processes: Guided Demo

## Day 1-ish

* [forkwait.c](src/forkwait.c): `fork()` and `wait()`
* [printstr_array.c](src/printstr_array.c): printing a string a character at a time
* [write.c](src/write.c): implementing `putchar()` with `write()`

## Day 2-ish

Note for `lssh`: you can just paste in the command line parsing code and tell
the students they can look up `strtok()` if they want more. It's just a
confusing stretch of code. Just tell them that it breaks the command line up
into an array of strings.

* [lssh.c](src/lssh.c): Lambda School Shell
* [pipe.c](src/pipe.c): `pipe()` demo
